                <h3>Anchor elements</h3>
                To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. An anchor <br>element is defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element we want to be a link with an &lt;a&gt; tag. <br>
                
                <!-- absolute links
                Links to pages on other websites on the internet are called absolute links. A typical absolute link will be made up of the following parts: protocol://domain/path -->


                <!-- open in same tab -->

                <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about">About The Odin Project</a><br>

                <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/about" target="_blank"

                <!-- rel attribute above. This attribute is used to describe the relation between the current page and the linked document.

                The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it was opened.

                The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. The noreferrer value also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used by itself as well. -->
                
                <!-- Relative links
                Links to other pages within our own website are called relative links -->
